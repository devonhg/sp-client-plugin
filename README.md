#Devons Tools Post Type API

The purpose of this framework is to make the creation of a post type for use in a plugin much easier. Using this hundreds of lines of code can be saved in post type setup and implementation. 

###Instructions

Do a search-replace accross all files in the pt-API directory and replace MYPLUGIN with your plugins name. This changes various classnames to insure that there is no collisions with other plugins that may happen to use this framework. 

Once done, simply include the class-core.php file in the pt-api folder in your core plugin php file and you are good to go!

For more information on the use of this plugin, which is mostly interacted with through the post_type class, refer to the wiki on this page.
